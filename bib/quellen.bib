	abstract = {The theory of ∗-autonomus categories was originally developed for symmetric monoidal categories. Since it has recently been seen as supplying models for linear logic and since there is interest in nonsymmetric linear logic (to provide, for example, models of temporal dependencies), there is also interest in a nonsymmetric version of ∗-autonomous categories. This paper provides the definition and develops some equivalent forms of the definition (which are a bit different in the nonsymmetric situation). It also gives a nonsymmetric version of the Chu construction, which has proven so useful in the past.}

Following this basic discovery, a completely new approach to the whole area between constructive logics and programmation is initiated.}

	abstract = {A cornerstone of the theory of proof nets for unit-free multiplicative linear logic (MLL) is the abstract representation of cut-free proofs modulo inessential rule commutation. The only known extension to additives, based on monomial weights, fails to preserve this key feature: a host of cut-free monomial proof nets can correspond to the same cut-free proof. Thus, the problem of finding a satisfactory notion of proof net for unit-free multiplicative-additive linear logic (MALL) has remained open since the inception of linear logic in 1986. We present a new definition of MALL proof net which remains faithful to the cornerstone of the MLL theory.},
